## About

The story behind **Weebinge**, where words took a weeb turn to create a unique and vibrant way of communication. Our language might have started as an inside joke among weebs, but it quickly evolved into something much more. Here's a peek into how it all began:

### The Birth of Weeb

The term **Weeb** initially emerged when I started using the word weeb to make fun of people who called people "Normies". What started as a simple description found its way into our convos. Soon, it became more than just a label â€“ it turned into a versatile word that added weebness into out chats.

### VCT: A Positive Twist

**VCT** began as an abbreviation for *Valorant Champions Tour*, but it didn't take long for us to adapt it to our language. It morphed into a term of positivity, agreement, and affirmation. Just a few letters can turn a sentence into a celebration, filling our chats with excitement and camaraderie.

### Mono and the Art of Wordplay

The story of **Mono** is both unique and humorous. Inspired by our friend Kemono's less-than-stellar Valorant skills, we started attaching "Mono" to various words. This not only paid homage to our friend but also turned even the simplest conversations into a kemono moment.
